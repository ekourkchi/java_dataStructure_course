<center><h1>Ordered Linked Lists</h1></center>

This assignment requires you to re-implement Linked Lists.  In particular,
nodes in your linked list will be ordered such that objects are stored
in alphabetical order.  This makes your linked list an ordered
linked list.

<p> Each ordered linked list is generic, that is, stores objects of
type <tt>E</tt>, where <tt>E</tt> is a parameter to the class.  However,
these linked lists also store, for each object, a string identifying
the object.  We refer to this string as the object's <b>key</b>.

</p><p>Each linked list node must therefore have three fields (instead
of the two in a normal linked list node): the object being stored,
its key, and the <tt>next</tt> reference.

</p><p>The nodes in the linked list are kept in order of increasing
key value.  For example, the object with key "abc" must be stored in a
node that is before any node with key "xyz".  Keys will be unique.
Keys are compared using the
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareToIgnoreCase%28java.lang.String%29">
<tt>String.compareToIgnoreCase</tt></a> method of the class <tt>String</tt>.
This method returns 0 if the two strings are equal, a negative number if this
string is less than the argument, and a positive number otherwise.

</p><p>You must implement three classes:

</p><ul>

<li> the <tt>KeyedNode</tt> class as a private class of
<tt>OrderedLinkedList</tt>,
</li><li> the <tt>OrderedLinkedList</tt> class, and 
</li><li> another class called <tt>AddressList</tt> that implements an address
book similar to what might be found in your cellphone.
</li></ul>

<p> The <tt>AddressList</tt> is used for testing only, and there is no
need to turn it in.

</p><p> The <tt>OrderedLinkedList</tt> class
must provide at least the following methods:
</p><ul>
<li> A no-arguments constructor <tt>public OrderedLinkedList()</tt> class
to create an empty ordered linked list.
</li><li> <tt>int size();</tt> Returns the number of elements in the
linked list.
</li><li> <tt>E add(String key, E value);</tt>  If the list does not
already contain the given key, the key and value are added to the
linked list, and <tt>add</tt> returns <tt>null</tt>.
<br> Otherwise,
the existing object with the given key is replaced with the new
object (and the new key), and <tt>add</tt> returns the old (removed)
object.
</li><li> <tt>E find(String key);</tt> Returns the matching object if
the corresponding key is in the ordered linked list, and <tt>null</tt>
otherwise.
</li><li> <tt>E get(int position);</tt> Returns the object at the given position,
as long as the index is valid. Otherwise, it returns
<tt>null</tt> 
(this is unlike the standard <tt>get</tt>, which throws an exception if
the index is invalid).
</li></ul>

Adding an object to the linked list must add it at the correct position.

<p>Finding a given key k should search through the linked list.  If
a key is found that is greater than k, the search can stop, since the
linked list is ordered and only other keys greater than k will follow
this one.

</p><p>Your address book class is not graded, so the details are up to you.

I would suggest that your address book class provide a user interface
that allows a user to:
</p><ul>
<li> add a (name, telephone number) pair into the address book.  The
name is used as the key.
If the name replaces a pre-existing name, print an appropriate message.
</li><li> search for a name in the address book, printing either the name and
telephone number, or reporting that the name is not in the address book.
</li><li> display the contents of the entire address book.  This is done by
calling <tt>get</tt> with increasing index, until the end of the ordered
linked list is reached.
</li></ul>

<!-- <p>The address book class should have a private inner class that -->
<!-- defines the data stored in the address book.  That data must -->
<!-- have names and telephone numbers, but may have more information, -->
<!-- such as email addresses. -->

<p>The details of the user interface are up to you.  At the very least,
you could print a prompt and have a user enter the command (one of
the strings "add", "find", or "print"), then ask for the appropriate parameters
for each.  Or if you prefer, you can open a window to get the input from
the user and report on the results.

</p><h2>Sample interaction</h2>

If using prompts and commands, your program could behave as follows.
The parts your program prints are in <tt>this font</tt>, the user input
is in <i>this font</i>.

<p>

<tt> Starting program, address book is empty. </tt>
<br><tt> enter one of: add, find, print, quit. </tt><i>add</i>
<br><tt> enter name to add. </tt><i>Hello World</i>
<br><tt> enter telephone number for 'Hello World'. </tt><i>1-800-555-0101</i>
</p><pre>'Hello World' added to telephone book, with number 1-800-555-0101
</pre>
<tt> The address book has 1 entry.</tt>
<br><tt> enter one of: add, find, print, quit. </tt><i>find</i>
<br><tt> enter name to search for. </tt><i>hello world</i>
<pre>'Hello World' was found, number is 1-800-555-0101
</pre>
<tt> The address book has 1 entry.</tt>
<br><tt> enter one of: add, find, print, quit. </tt><i>find</i>
<br><tt> enter name to search for. </tt><i>foo</i>
<pre>'foo' was not found
</pre>
<tt> The address book has 1 entry.</tt>
<br><tt> enter one of: add, find, print, quit. </tt><i>add</i>
<br><tt> enter name to add. </tt><i>hello world</i>
<br><tt> enter telephone number for 'hello world'. </tt><i>1-800-555-0105</i>
<pre>'hello world' added to telephone book, with number 1-800-555-0105
previous phone number for 'Hello World' was 1-800-555-0101.
</pre>
<tt> The address book has 1 entry.</tt>
<br><tt> enter one of: add, find, print, quit. </tt><i>add</i>
<br><tt> enter name to add. </tt><i>foo</i>
<br><tt> enter telephone number for 'foo'. </tt><i>1-800-555-0102</i>
<pre>'foo' added to telephone book, with number 1-800-555-0101
</pre>
<tt> The address book has 2 entries.</tt>
<br><tt> enter one of: add, find, print, quit. </tt><i>print</i>
<pre>'foo'  1-800-555-0102
'Hello World'  1-800-555-0101
</pre>
<tt> The address book has 2 entries.</tt>
<br><tt> enter one of: add, find, print, quit. </tt><i>quit</i>
<pre>quit, discarding contents of address book.
</pre>

<p> Note that "Hello World", with uppercase letters, is replaced by
"hello world" written with lowercase letters.  Using the
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareToIgnoreCase%28java.lang.String%29">
<tt>String.compareToIgnoreCase</tt></a> method, the two appear to
be the same, that is, the comparison returns 0, but displaying the values
shows that they are not identical.

</p><p>Also note that when printing, the names are returned in alphabetical
order, since the linked list is ordered.

</p><h2>Optional Extension</h2>

<p> If you want to make your address book code more useful, you may
extend it as follows.  This is for your own personal enjoyment and use,
and no extra credit will be given.

</p><p> Add the following method to the Ordered Linked List class:
</p><ul>
<li> <tt>E remove(String key);</tt> Behaves as <tt>find</tt>, but
also removes the object if it is found.
</li></ul>

<p> Also add operations to your address book class.  In particular, you
can allow the user to:
</p><ul>
<li> save the contents of the address book into a file.
</li><li> create a new address book from the contents of a previously saved file
(this should only be allowed initially, when the address book is still
empty).  Each name is read from the file and saved into the
linked list.  The file format is up to you, as long as all the information
originally in the address book is correctly restored.
</li><li> remove a name from the address book, printing whether the name was
successfully found and removed.
</li></ul>

<p>
You can define a private inner class to store whatever values you want
in your address book.  The values should include names and telephone
numbers, but may have more information, such as email addresses.

</p><p> This private inner class can have a constructor that creates an
address book entry given a string (say, a line read from a file), and
a <tt>toString()</tt> method that produces a string that can be stored
in a file.  This allows you to make your address book persistent.

</p><p>Both saving the address book, and printing it, are accomplished
by calling <tt>get</tt> repeatedly, once for each entry in the address
book, and calling <tt>toString()</tt> for each object.  You may use
<tt>toString()</tt> to give you the data to save in the file, or you
may have a different method such as <tt>toFileString()</tt>.  What is
important is that you have a constructor that takes the output of
<tt>toString()</tt> or <tt>toFileString()</tt> and gives you a new
address book entry.

</p><h2>Turning in the Assignment</h2>

<p> You are only required to turn in the one file containing the
<tt>OrderedLinkedList</tt> class and its inner <tt>KeyedNode</tt> class.
