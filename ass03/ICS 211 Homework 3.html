<center><h1>Searching in an array</h1></center>

<p> Write a class, <tt>ArraySearch&lt;E&gt;</tt> that provides two
methods:

</p><ul>

<li> <tt>int find (E [] haystack, E needle);</tt>

</li><li> <tt>int first_duplicate (E [] data);</tt>

</li></ul>

<p> The method <tt>find</tt> searches the haystack array to see if any
of its elements is the same (as determined by the <tt>equals</tt> method)
as the needle.  If there is a match, <tt>find</tt> returns the index of
the first match.  Otherwise, <tt>find</tt> throws the
exception <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/MissingResourceException.html"><tt>java.util.MissingResourceException</tt></a>.

</p><p> The method <tt>first_duplicate</tt> searches the data array to see if
any two different elements of the array are the same, again as determined
by the <tt>equals</tt> method.  The return value is the index of the
first duplicate found, or -1 if each of the elements of the array is
unique, i.e., no element of the array is equal to any other element
of the array.

</p><p> You will also have to write code to test your <tt>ArraySearch</tt>
class.  Include this test code with your submission.  This test code
will not be graded, but it may help the TA give you better feedback.

</p><h2>Algorithm Analysis</h2>

Write up a runtime analysis of each of the two methods, giving the big-O
of each, and explaining how you got your results.  Send your analysis to
the TA together with your code.  This part counts for 25% of the grade
on this assignment.  Even if your code doesn't work, you should do this
part to the best of your ability.
