<center><h1>ICS 211 Homework 2</h1></center>

<center><h1>Classes and Interfaces</h1></center>

Write each of the following:

<ul>
<li> A class <tt>Point</tt> to represent points in a two-dimensional
plane.  Each point has an x and a y coordinate, determined at creation
time, and provides at least the following methods:
<ul>
<li> <tt>double getX();  // return x-coordinate of point</tt>
</li><li> <tt>double getY();  // return y-coordinate of point</tt>
</li><li> <tt>double distance(Point other);
// computes and returns the distance from this point to another point</tt>
</li><li> <tt>String toString();  // returns the string "(x,y)" </tt>
</li></ul>
The distance between two points is given by the square root of
(x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + 
(y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
<p>
If you find it helpful for the rest of the assignment, you may implement
in this class additional methods beyond the ones required above.

</p><p>
</p></li><li> An interface <tt>SegmentInterface</tt> to represent line segments in the
two-dimensional plane.  Each line segment has two endpoints, initialized at
creation time, and provides at least the following methods:
<ul>
<li> <tt>Point left();   // the point at the left end of the segment </tt>
</li><li> <tt>Point right();  // the point at the right end of the segment </tt>
</li><li> <tt>Point upper();  // the point at the upper end of the segment </tt>
</li><li> <tt>Point lower();  // the point at the lower end of the segment </tt>
</li><li> <tt>double length();
// the length of the segment, that is, the distance between its endpoints</tt>
</li></ul>
For horizontal segments the <tt>upper</tt> and <tt>lower</tt>
methods may return either endpoint, and for vertical segments the
<tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> methods may also return either endpoint.

<p>

</p></li><li> A class <tt>Segment</tt> that implements <tt>SegmentInterface</tt>,
and also provides these additional methods:
<ul>
<li> <tt>boolean isHorizontal();</tt>
</li><li> <tt>boolean isVertical();</tt>
</li><li> <tt>void move(Point newLowerOrLeft);</tt>
</li><li> <tt>String toString();</tt>
</li></ul>
The <tt>move</tt> method changes the position of the entire segment
by moving the lower point to the new position.  In other words, the
entire segment moves, without changing its length or angle, so that the
lower point is in the new position.  For horizontal segments (where
both endpoints have the same y coordinate), it moves the left point
to the new position.

<p>
The <tt>toString</tt> method returns the string
"(x1,y1)(x2,y2)", where (x1,y1) is the lower endpoint of the segment
(the left endpoint for horizontal segments).

</p><p>
</p></li><li> A class <tt>CreateSegments</tt> that
has the following:
<ul>
<li> A method <tt>printFour</tt> to print the values of 4 segment
variables, that is,
one method that takes four <tt>SegmentInterface</tt> variables
as parameters and prints all four.
</li><li> A method <tt>static void unitTest ();</tt> with all of the following:
</li><li> Two variables declared as <tt>SegmentInterface</tt>, one of them
with coordinates (1,2)(4,5), the other (1,2)(4,2)
</li><li> Two variables declared as <tt>Segment</tt>, one of them
with coordinates (4,5)(4,2), the other (0,0)(7,1.5)
</li><li> code to:
<ol>
<li> print the four segment variables, then 
</li><li> move the last segment to the left by 5.3 units, so its
endpoints become (-5.3, 0)(1.7, 1.5), and
</li><li> print all the segment variables again.
</li></ol>
</li></ul>

</li><li> For each class (except <tt>CreateSegments</tt>), you will have to
provide one or more constructors that take the appropriate parameters,
as well as a default (no-arguments) constructor that initializes all
coordinates to zero.

</li><li> In order to test your code, you will have to create a main method
in a different class.  That main method calls CreateSegment.unitTest();
<p>
Do not turn in your main method, or any other test code.

</p></li></ul>
