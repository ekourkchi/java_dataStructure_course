******************************************************

This program uses a Min-heap to implement the priority queue.
The unit of time is 1/10 of hour or any long integer number.
This version is not supporting the combination of hour, minute and second for now.

The Driver takes the file "input.txt" and prints out the proper schedule.
The output list of the scheduled task is stored in this file as well: mySchedule.txt

This program also prints the resulting schedule as well as the time spent to add and remove the records into the Heap
on the screen.



    To compile the program:
     > javac Driver.java
     
    To run the program:
     > java Driver
