<center><h1>ICS 211 Homework 7</h1></center>
<center><h1>Queue assignment</h1></center>

<p> In this assignment, you implement two classes of generic queues
that support the following methods:

</p><pre>boolean offer(T value);  // returns true if the insertion succeeds
T poll();                // returns the first object, or null if there are none
</pre>

<p>These queues have two special properties:

</p><ol>

<li> any null value given to <tt>offer</tt> must be discarded rather than
added at the end of the queue, and <tt>offer</tt> must return false.

</li><li> if the value is the same (as determined by calling
<tt>value.equals(...)</tt>) as any value already in the queue, the
value should again not be inserted, and <tt>offer</tt> must return
false.

</li></ol>

<p>The first class you implement must use a linked list to implement
these queue methods, and the queue grows to whatever size is needed.
This class should be called <tt>LinkedQueue</tt>.

</p><p>The second class you implement must use an array to implement this
queue class.  The size of this array should be 10 and never change.
That is, if <tt>offer</tt> is called to insert an 11th element
into this queue, <tt>offer</tt> should return false.
This class should be called <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>.

</p><p> To implement the first queue you may use the generic node class
(presented in the lectures), or your own similar generic node class.
The second queue <b>must</b> be implemented using a fixed-size Java
array.

</p><p> You must also build your own test code to make sure that your
implementation works.  Turn in your test code together with the two
classes <tt>LinkedQueue</tt> and <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>.

</p><p>For this project you may use and adapt any of the code presented
as part of the class, including any code in the book or on the course
web site.  None of this code will do exactly what is needed for the
assignment, but you are welcome to adapt it to suit your needs.  If you
do adapt code from the website or the book, provide a comment clearly
indicating the source of your material (except you do not need to do this
for the generic LinkedNode class), specifying the pages in the book or
the URLs from which you have drawn your inspiration for parts of your code.
